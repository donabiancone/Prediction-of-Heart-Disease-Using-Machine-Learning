# Prediction of Heart Disease Using Machine Learning
 Prediction of Heart Disease Using Machine Learning Algorithms
 
The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing and exploratory data analysis. Then, different models were trained and predictions are made with different algorithms: KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression etc. 

The jupyter notebook contains also the detailed report in markdown (in italian).

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
Neural Network (Keras)


Accuracy achieved: 93,88% (Random Forest)
